          <h2>A little bit About Harvesters</h2>
          <p>
            On the 13th of December, 2003, the world saw the birth of the great
            change agent – The Harvesters dream; a divine vision, given to
            Pastor Bolaji Idowu, started off with just a handful of people. Over
            the years, proving that with faith, determination, focus and the
            right team, anything is possible, what started with just a roomful
            of people has grown to be the most desirable place of worship. With
            locations across Nigeria, the United Kingdom and the United States
            of America, Harvesters attracts over 70,000 worshippers both online
            and onsite.
